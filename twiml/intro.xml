        <Say>Hello, this is Mayor Michael Nutter with an important message for after school providers in Philadelphia. Each year, After School Activities Partnerships, better known as "ASAP", publishes a free directory of after school programs to appear in the Philadelphia Daily News as a resource for parents, youth and caregivers in the region. This summer, "ASAP" and the City of Philadelphia are teaming up to make this directory available on the city’s 311 mobile platform. To support this effort, we are asking all after school providers to update their information in the coming weeks. To update your information now or to learn more about "ASAP"’s Directory, press one to speak directory coordinator, Paul Carroll. Or to submit information for a new location, go online to w-w-w dot philly a-s-a-p dot org and follow the links to submit a new directory listing. We appreciate your help and thank you for doing your part to keep our city’s children safe and engaged after school.</Say>
        <Say>To repeat these instructions, press four.</Say>

    <Say>Why didn't you saying anything? Well, goodbye then.</Say>
